                The term PHP is an acronym for -Hypertext Preprocessor. <br>

                PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is an open-source
                which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The file extension of
                PHP is ".php" <br>

                PHP is a server-side scripting language created primarily for web development but it is also used as a
                general-purpose programming language. Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, which are executed
                on the user’s browser, PHP scripts run on the server. The results are then sent to the client’s web
                browser as plain HTML.
